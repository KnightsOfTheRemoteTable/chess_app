      ' Online Chess is a full-stack, Ruby on Rails web application that allows
      ' for multiple players to play chess (with all rules enforced) and to
      ' receive real-time updates as the opposing player moves and other
      ' relevant game events occur (e.g. a player is put into check).

      ' The application uses best-of-breed methodologies and approaches,
      ' including the use of Agile workflows (i.e. weekly standups, frequent
      ' pairing and code review, etc.). Code that is finally approved for
      ' merging into our master branch is first pushed through a Codeship
      ' Continuous Integration server, which runs a complete suite of tests
      ' as well as a code linter. Code is then pushed into production on a
      ' Heroku server.
